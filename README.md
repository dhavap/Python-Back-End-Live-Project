# Live-Projects
<h2>Introduction</h2>
As a student of The Tech Academy, I worked on Python live projects for 2 2-week sprints. I got to experience working on different projects at varying stages of completion in a team of fellow software developers. This repository provides an overview of the stories I worked on. I got to experience starting up a new project as well as adding to and amending code in an existing, ongoing project. I worked on both front end and back end stories using the Django framework. 

I have included descriptions of the stories I worked on below, along with screenshots of my code snippets from the project.

<h2>Back End Stories</h2>
<h4>Web Scraping</h4>
I was tasked with extracting data from a Wikipedia page on the timeline of space exploration. I created a dropdown list allowing users to select the decade of space exploration they wished to view. I used Beautiful Soup to parse and extract the relecant data from the webpage. I then used Pandas to create a table out of the parsed data. 


```
#============== Rendering page with decade options for user to choose from
def space_exploration(request):
    decades = {'decades' : DECADE_OPTIONS}
    return render(request, 'explorationTimeline/space_exploration.html', decades)

#============== Using BeautifulSoup to get tables from Wikipage based on user selected decade
def result(request, decade):  #pass the user selected variable 'decade' into the function
    print("Decade selected: " + str(decade)) #prints to console for development purposes
    getPage = requests.get("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Solar_System_exploration") #get the page
    src = getPage.content #store the page's contents as a variable
    soup = BeautifulSoup(src, 'html.parser') #parse the content of the page
    missionsTable = soup.find(id= decade).findNext('table', {"class" : "wikitable"}) # get the requested table by looking at the table after the table headline   
    #print(missionsTable)

    create_table = [['Mission Name', 'Launch Date', 'Country', 'Wikipage']] #create list to put extracted data into
    rows = missionsTable.find_all('tr')[1:] #extract all rows except the first row because it is a header

    for row in rows: #loop through all the rows to extract desired data
        if decade in ('1950s', '1960s', '1970s'):
            mission_name = row.find_all('a')[1].get_text() #extract mission name
            wiki_link = 'https://en.m.wikipedia.org' + row.find_all('a')[1].get('href') # extract href
        elif decade in ('1980s', '1990s', '2000s', '2010s', 'Planned_or_scheduled'):
            mission_name = row.td.find('a', recursive= False).get_text() #extract mission name
            wiki_link = 'https://en.m.wikipedia.org' + row.td.find('a', recursive= False).get('href') # extract href
        launch_date = row.find_all('td')[1].get_text()[:-1]
        country = row.find('a').get('title')
        wikipage= '<a href="' + wiki_link + '">More Info</a>' # concatenate href to create link to mission wikipage
        display_row = [mission_name, launch_date, country, wikipage] # create a row
        create_table.append(display_row) # add the rows to the table

    df = pd.DataFrame(create_table[1:], columns = create_table[0]) #create table via Pandas module
    data = df.to_html(escape = False) #convert table to html
    #print(data)
    context = {
        'data' : data,
        'decade': decade,
    }
    return render(request, 'explorationTimeline/result.html', context)
```
