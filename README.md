# Live-Projects
As a student of The Tech Academy, I worked on Python live projects for 2 2-week sprints of my course(a total of one month). I got to experience working on different projects at varying stages of completion. This repository provides an overview of the stories I worked on. I got to experience starting up a new project as well as adding to and amending code in an existing, ongoing project. I worked on both front end and back end stories using the Django framework. 

I have included descriptions of the stories I worked on below with screenshots of code snippets from the project.
